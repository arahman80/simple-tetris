info:
    8 rst instructions
    rst 0x28 -> gateway to syscall jump table
    bcall is expanded to:
        rst 0x28     ; jump to rom dispatcher
        .dw <offset> ; 16-bit little endian offset
    
    if assembler doesn't have .dw:
        .db offset & 0xFF, (offset >> 8) & 0xFF
    
    offsets will be derived from ti83plus.inc

use make -j$(nproc) to compile at the speed of light
